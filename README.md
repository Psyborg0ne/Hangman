# Hangman
Hangman game written in python that uses a random word from file
## Features
1. Uses random word every time from a file 'words' in the same directory
2. You can only guess one letter or a word of same length as the hidden word (else your guess doesn't count)
3. Prints remaining lines as well as the previous guesses you made
4. Clears screen in both windows and \*nix machines
5. 49 lines of code! (Maybe I missed something important though :P)
### Usage
Use `python3 hangman.py` or <br> `python3.exe hangman.py` *(windows only)*
#### Issues
I wanted to print heart character instead of <3 without converting to ascii but didn't manage to find anything helpful. Feedback is much appreciated!
